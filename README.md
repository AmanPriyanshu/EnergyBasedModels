# EnergyBasedModels
An energy-based model is a probabilistic model governed by an energy function that describes the probability of a certain state. 

This repository aims to provide streamlined code for fast implementation required during training of such models.

## Targets:

1. Restricted Boltzmann Machines - for Pre-Training
2. Restricted Boltzmann Machines - for Synthetic Data Generation
2. Deep Belief Networks - for Pre-training
3. Deep Belief Networks - for Synthetic Data Generation

## Installation:

`git clone https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/EnergyBasedModels.git`

## Implementation:

To be filled
